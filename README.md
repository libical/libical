## About

Libical — an implementation of iCalendar protocols and data formats

Most of the code in here was written by Eric Busboom at the end
of the last millennium with help from dozens of contributors.
It is currently maintained by Allen Winter and the libical team
at <https://libical.github.io/libical>.

Libical is an Open Source implementation of the iCalendar protocols
and protocol data units. The iCalendar specification describes how
calendar clients can communicate with calendar servers so users can
store their calendar data and arrange meetings with other users.

Thanks to our [contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

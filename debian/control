Description: iCalendar library implementation in C (development)
 libical is an open source implementation of the IETF's iCalendar calendaring
 and scheduling protocols (RFC 2445, 2446, and 2447). It parses iCal components
 and provides a C API for manipulating the component properties, parameters,
 and subcomponents.
 .
 This package contains the libical development files.

LIBICAL -- an implementation of iCalendar protocols and data formats

Most of the code in here was written by Eric Busboom with help from
dozens of contributors.  It is currently maintained by Art Cancro
and Wilfried Goesgens.

The code and datafiles in this distribution are licensed under the

This dual license ensures that the library can be incorporated into
both proprietary code and GPL'd programs, and will benefit from
improvements made by programmers in both realms.  We will only accept
changes into the library if they are similarly dual-licensed.

Building the library
--------------------

This distribution is developed on CentOS Linux and should also
build cleanly on any unix-like system as long as it has the usual
set of open source build tools online.

The library is configured with automake. IF YOU ARE BUILDING THE
SOURCE FROM A TARBALL, From the root directory, run

	./configure

To build all of the Makefiles for your system. If you will be
installing the library, you may want to use the --prefix flag to set
the directory where the library and header files will be installed.

	./configure --prefix=/proj/local/

If configure runs fine, run "make" to build the library and 
"make install" to install it.

Although the distribution uses libtool to generate libraries, it has
shared libraries turned off by default. To create and install shared
libraries use:

	./configure --enable-shared


IF YOU ARE BUILDING FROM SVN, there will be no configure file until
you create one with the "bootstrap" script.

The current version of libical focuses on creating and
manipulating iCal objects. With it, you can parse text representations
of iCal components, add and remove sub-components, properties,
parameters and values, and print the components back out as strings. 


Notes for Libical Developers
----------------------------

If you don't want to use gcc as the compiler, and you got the sources
from SVN, you should set the CC variable to the path to the compiler
and run "automake --include-deps" to keep automake from using
gcc-specific automatic dependancy tracking.

        > CC=/pkg/SUNWspro/bin/cc; export CC
        > automake --include-deps
        > ./configure --prefix=/proj/local/
        > make

You will not need to re-run automake unless you got the sources from SVN. 

When updating to a new release, tweak the version number in the following files:
CMakeLists.txt
configure.in
src/libical/icalversion.h
src/java/Makefile.am
src/libicalcap/Makefile.am
src/libical/Makefile.am
src/libicalss/Makefile.am
src/libicalvcal/Makefile.am
src/java/CMakeLists.txt
src/libicalcap/CMakeLists.txt
src/libicalss/CMakeLists.txt
src/libicalvcal/CMakeLists.txt


Using the Library
-----------------

There is rudimentary, unfinished documentation in the /doc directory,
and annotated examples in /examples and the test code in src/test.

Sourcecode now in SVN
---------------------
We now work in our SF.net SVN Repository. Please don't use the CVS anymore.

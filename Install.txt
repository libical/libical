Libical uses the CMake buildsystem.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
and c:/Program Files on Windows.  You can change this by
passing -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

To build a debug version pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to cmake.

To build libical you will need:
 - CMake version 3.1.0 or higher
 - Perl
 - libicu (not required but strongly recommended)
 - a C compiler (let us know if the build fails with your C compiler)

Building on Unix with gcc or clang:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
% make install

Building on Windows with MicroSoft Visual Studio:
From a command prompt for the version of MSVC you want to use
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
% nmake
% nmake install

NOTE: Some MSVC 32bit compilers (like MSVC2005) use a 64bit version of time_t.
In these cases you must pass -DUSE_32BIT_TIME_T=true to cmake to make sure
the 32bit version of time_t is used instead.

Building on Windows with mingw:
Make sure you have the path to the MinGW programs in %PATH% first, for example:
% set "PATH=c:\MinGW\mingw64\bin;%PATH%"
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
% mingw32-make
% mingw32-make install

Building on Windows under Cygwin:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
% make install

Building on MSYS with mingw:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..
% nmake
% nmake install

To run the test suite, from inside the build directory
run 'make test' (or 'nmake test' or 'mingw32-make test')

To run the test suite in verbose mode, pass ARGS="-V" to the make command
For example: nmake test ARGS="-V"

By default, the buildsystem creates shared(dynamic) and static versions
of the libraries, but that behavior can be modified at CMake time:
 - To build the static libraries only, pass -DSTATIC_ONLY=True to CMake.
 - To build the shared libraries only, pass -DSHARED_ONLY=True to CMake.

== Building with Different Compilers ==
For example, say you want to use Clang to build on Linux.
Then you can set the C and C++ compilers at CMake time, like so:
% CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ..

== Building for OSX (Mac) ==
Homebrew:
  A couple of necessary dependencies do not have their headers
  and development libraries linked into /usr/local/{include,lib} due
  to possible contamination with the operating system versions of the
  same name.  This is known to be the case with libffi and libxml2
  Fix is to export PKG_CONFIG_PATH so CMake can find them, as in:
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig:\
                           /usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig

  Also, if building the gtkdocs you'll need to say where the xml
  catalog files can be found so the gtk entities are located, like so:
    export XML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/local/etc/xml/catalog

== Optional Dependencies ==
* libicu "International Components for Unicode" development libraries.
  Highly recommended for RSCALE support.
  libicu can be found at http://www.icu-project.org

  If CMake doesn't locate your libicu installation try setting the
  ICU_BASE environment variable to the top folder where its installed
  and run cmake again.

* Berkeley DB storage.
  Optional for the Berkeley Database storage support.
  The development toolkit can be found at http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db

  ** This code path has not been fully tested.
  ** Don't be surprised if there are bugs.
  ** Do NOT use for production code.

* GObject Introspection.  To generate GObject introspection "typelib"
  files pass the -DGOBJECT_INTROSPECTION=True option to CMake.  You'll
  need to have the GObject Introspection development package v0.6.7 or higher
  installed beforehand.

You can also force CMake to ignore any of the optional dependencies
by passing the option -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PACKAGE>=True.
For instance:
# tell cmake to ignore ICU
  % cmake -DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_ICU=True

== Language Bindings ==
This C library can be built with bindings for these other languages:
* C++. If a C++ compiler is found the buildsystem will create and install the C++ bindings API.
  Turn this off by passing -DWITH_CXX_BINDINGS=False option to CMake.
  Don't mix ABI from C and C++ compilers.

* There are Java, Perl, PHP and Python bindings but they are old and haven't
  been tested in a very long time.  Volunteers wanted.

== Tweaking the Library Behavior ==
Use these CMake options to adjust the library behavior as follows:
 * ICAL_ERRORS_ARE_FATAL=[true|false]
   Set to make icalerror_* calls abort instead of internally signaling an error.
   Default=false

 * ICAL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PROPERTIES=[true|false]
   Set to prevent empty properties from being replaced with X-LIC-ERROR properties.
   Default=false

 * USE_BUILTIN_TZDATA=[true|false]
   Set to build using our own (instead of the system's) timezone data.
   Default=false (use the system timezone data on non-Windows systems)
   ALWAYS true on Windows systems

== Tweaking the Installation Directories ==
By default, the installation layout is according to the GNU standard installation directories.
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html

You can override various installation folders by passing the following variables to CMake:
 CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR = The fullpath where you want the put the installed libraries
 CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR = The fullpath where you want to put the installed include files
 CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR = The fullpath where to want to put the shared files

for example: cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=/opt/lib32 ..

== Build the documentation ==
Run 'make docs' to build the API documentation and reference.
Disable the docs make target by running CMake with -DICAL_BUILD_DOCS=False option.
Disable the libical-glib developer documentation by running CMake with -DENABLE_GTK_DOC=False.

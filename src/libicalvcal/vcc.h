/* NOTE regarding Parse_MIME_FromFile
The function above, Parse_MIME_FromFile, comes in two flavors,
neither of which is exported from the DLL. Each version takes
a CFile or FILE* as a parameter, neither of which can be
passed across a DLL interface (at least that is my experience).
If you are linking this code into your build directly then
you may find them a more convenient API that the other flavors
that take a file name. If you use them with the DLL LIB you
will get a link error.

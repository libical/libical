/**
 * @file qsort_flex.h
 * @brief An implementation of qsort that is more flexible than the version
 * provided with stdlib.
 *
 * In contrast to the qsort provided with stdlib, this version doesn't assume
 * that the data to be sorted is stored in a contiguous block of memory.
 */
 
/**
 * @brief Sort an arbitrary list of items using the qsort algorithm.
 * @param context A pointer representing the list to be sorted. Won't be
 * interpreted by this function but passed to the compar and swapr functions.
 * @param nitems The number of items in the list.
 * @param compar The comparator function. The function receives the pointer
 * to the list to be sorted and the indices of the elements to be compared.
 * @param swapr The function used to swap two elements within the list. The
 * function receives the pointer to the list to be sorted and the indices of
 * the elements to be compared.

 * @param m2 Pointer to the second block of memory.

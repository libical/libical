/**     @file icaltime.h
 *      @brief struct icaltimetype is a pseudo-object that abstracts time
 *      handling.
 *
 *      It can represent either a DATE or a DATE-TIME (floating, UTC or in a
 *      given timezone), and it keeps track internally of its native timezone.
 *
 *      The typical usage is to call the correct constructor specifying the
 *      desired timezone. If this is not known until a later time, the
 *      correct behavior is to specify a NULL timezone and call
 *      icaltime_convert_to_zone() at a later time.
 *
 *      There are several ways to create a new icaltimetype:
 *
 *      - icaltime_null_time()
 *      - icaltime_null_date()
 *      - icaltime_current_time_with_zone()
 *      - icaltime_today()
 *      - icaltime_from_timet_with_zone(icaltime_t tm, int is_date,
 *              icaltimezone *zone)
 *      - icaltime_from_day_of_year(int doy, int year)
 *
 *      italtimetype objects can be converted to different formats:
 *
 *      - icaltime_as_timet(struct icaltimetype tt)
 *      - icaltime_as_timet_with_zone(struct icaltimetype tt,
 *              icaltimezone *zone)
 *      - icaltime_as_ical_string(struct icaltimetype tt)
 *
 *      Accessor methods include:
 *
 *      - icaltime_get_timezone(struct icaltimetype t)
 *      - icaltime_get_tzid(struct icaltimetype t)
 *      - icaltime_set_timezone(struct icaltimetype t, const icaltimezone *zone)
 *      - icaltime_day_of_year(struct icaltimetype t)
 *      - icaltime_day_of_week(struct icaltimetype t)
 *      - icaltime_start_doy_week(struct icaltimetype t, int fdow)
 *      - icaltime_week_number(struct icaltimetype t)
 *
 *      Query methods include:
 *
 *      - icaltime_is_null_time(struct icaltimetype t)
 *      - icaltime_is_valid_time(struct icaltimetype t)
 *      - icaltime_is_date(struct icaltimetype t)
 *      - icaltime_is_utc(struct icaltimetype t)
 *
 *      Modify, compare and utility methods include:
 *
 *      - icaltime_compare(struct icaltimetype a,struct icaltimetype b)
 *      - icaltime_compare_date_only(struct icaltimetype a,
 *              struct icaltimetype b)
 *      - icaltime_adjust(struct icaltimetype *tt, int days, int hours,
 *              int minutes, int seconds);
 *      - icaltime_normalize(struct icaltimetype t);
 *      - icaltime_convert_to_zone(const struct icaltimetype tt,
 *              icaltimezone *zone);

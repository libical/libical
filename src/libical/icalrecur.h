@file icalrecur.h
@brief Routines for dealing with recurring time

How to use:

1) Get a rule and a start time from a component

@code
        icalproperty rrule;
        struct icalrecurrencetype *recur;
        struct icaltimetype dtstart;

        rrule = icalcomponent_get_first_property(comp,ICAL_RRULE_PROPERTY);
        recur = icalproperty_get_rrule(rrule);
        start = icalproperty_get_dtstart(dtstart);
@endcode

Or, just make them up:

@code
        recur = icalrecurrencetype_new_from_string("FREQ=YEARLY;BYDAY=SU,WE");
        dtstart = icaltime_from_string("19970101T123000")
@endcode

2) Create an iterator

@code
        icalrecur_iterator *ritr;
        ritr = icalrecur_iterator_new(recur, start);
@endcode

3) Iterator over the occurrences

@code
        struct icaltimetype next;
        while (next = icalrecur_iterator_next(ritr)
               && !icaltime_is_null_time(next){
                Do something with next
        }
@endcode

Note that the time returned by icalrecur_iterator_next is in
whatever timezone that dtstart is in.

4) Deallocate a rule

@code
        icalrecurrencetype_unref(recur);
@endcode

The icalrecurrencetype object is reference counted. It will automatically be deallocated when the
reference count goes to zero.

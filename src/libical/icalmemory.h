/**
 * @file icalmemory.h
 * @brief Common memory management routines.
 *
 * libical often passes strings back to the caller. To make these
 * interfaces simple, I did not want the caller to have to pass in a
 * memory buffer, but having libical pass out newly allocated memory
 * makes it difficult to de-allocate the memory.
 *
 * The ring buffer in this scheme makes it possible for libical to pass out
 * references to memory which the caller does not own, and be able to
 * de-allocate the memory later. The ring allows libical to have several buffers
 * active simultaneously, which is handy when creating string representations of
 * components. Methods for working with these temporary buffers are marked with
 * `icalmemory_tmp_*()`.
 *
 * Other memory management routines include wrappers around the system
 * management routines like icalmemory_new_buffer() and icalmemory_free_buffer()
 * as well as routines to work with strings, like icalmemory_append_string().

 *
 * Creates a temporary buffer on the ring. Regardless of what @a size you
 * specify, the buffer will always be at least ::MIN_BUFFER_SIZE big, and it
 * will be zeroed out.
 *
 * @par Error handling
 * If there is a problem allocating memory for the buffer, it sets ::icalerrno
 * to ::ICAL_NEWFAILED_ERROR and returns `NULL`.
 *
 * @par Ownership
 * The returned buffer is owned by icalmemory. It must not be freed by the
 * caller and the returned memory will be automatically reclaimed as more items
 * are added to the ring buffer.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * ```c
 * char *str = icalmemory_tmp_buffer(256);
 * strcpy(str, "some data");
 *
 * // use str

 * buffers have been created or added, or after ::icalmemory_free_ring() has
 * been called. Note that freeing the buffers is done using the
 * icalmemory_free_buffer() function, which by default is a wrapper around the
 * standard free() function. However, if the memory management functions are
 * customized by the user, the user has to take care to only pass in buffers
 * that have been allocated accordingly.
 *
 * @par Error handling
 * No error is raised if @a buf is `NULL`.
 *
 * @par Ownership
 * After adding @a buf to the ring, it becomes owned by icalmemory and must not
 * be `free()`d manually anymore, it leads to a double-`free()` when icalmemory
 * reclaims the memory.
